

First of all, I made a folder named site-content in C drive. Then I created an index.html file.



To run basic server, I used the following code
docker run -it --rm -d -p 9090:80 --name web nginx


To stop this server, I typed: 

docker stop web


To link my webpage to the server, I used: 

docker run -it --rm -d -p 9090:80 --name site-content -v C:/site-content:/usr/share/nginx/html nginx

This linked my webpage to the server
